Maze Melody is a dodecahedron-shaped digital musical instrument. It produces different tune according to different angles.

#### Why do I make it
I am a music lover and a game lover, and the project is to explore how movement and music could influence and interact with each other.

#### Influences
##### ▶︎ [The Rain Project - SeeekLab](http://www.seeeklab.com/en/portfolio-item/rainproject/#)
In this project, there's a room full of big glowing "rain drops". When the rain drops are touched by audience, it will change into another color and produce melody. Design and developed by SeeekLab(an interactive media lab based in Xiamen, China), the project is designed for children with autism and to encourage them to contact with people.

##### ▶︎ Monument Valley

The interaction between movement and sound in this game inspired my Maze Melody idea.

##### ▶︎ [Eye VDJ Masa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMc0HedyhKk&t=1s)
Eye VDJ Masa is an ALS patient. Due to the fact that his limbs are paralyzed, he produce music with a pair of special glasses that tracks the movement of his eyes.
