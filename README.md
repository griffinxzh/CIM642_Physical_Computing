## Sensor Walk
I am a music lover and I went to an musical instrument store. The DJ equipments got my attention. After chatting with the staff in store, I learned that when the DJ are producing music, the LED background light reacts to the sound. The way the LED background lights respond to music are programmed by a group of specialist before the performance. That inspired me to make an installation about music.
