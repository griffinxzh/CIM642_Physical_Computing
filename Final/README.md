Based on Maze Melody midterm project, the Mood Melody is a more developed version than the prototype.
In this project, I create a piano keyboard with GameSalad game engine replacing the low fidelity speaker for the sound output, and I made the physical interface with a 3D-printed dodecahedron structure and a lasercutted pentagon as a shelf inside the structure. Besides, I replace the Arduino Uno board with the Adafruit Feather 32U4 board to make the installation lighter.
